    <ul>
        <br>
        <li>I understand that Title 18, Section 1001 of the U.S. Code states that a person is guilty
            of a felony for knowingly and<br>
            willingly making a false or fraudulent statement to any department of the United States
            Government or subgrantees.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>I understand that all information and documents provided, except as exempted pursuant to
            law, are a matter of public

        </li>
        <br>
        <li>I understand that if benefits received following receipt of HAU funds are a duplication
            of benefits received from other
            sources such as federal benefits or charitable donations, that any subsequent assistance
            received HAU leads will be
            informed and the rent subsidy payment will discontinue.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>I authorize the HAU lead to contact the landlord/property manager, employer, agencies,
            utility providers, and other
            applicable individuals for information about my family or myself for the purpose of
            rental assistance. This authorization includes any exempt or confidential information
            and all agencies and individuals with whom I have worked or may work
            through referral by any agency.

            utility assistance.

        <br>
        <li>I understand that if I received additional benefits (including charitable donations)
            following my receipt of HAU funds, and
            those benefits are a duplication of the HAU funds/benefits that I have already or will
            receive, that I will notify HAU of the
            receipt of these benefits and that my rent subsidy payment will be discontinued or
            proportionally reduced.
